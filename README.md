I also work at Godfathers Pizza where Ive been creating exceptional pizzas since August 2021. Working in the food industry Ive learned a lot about dealing with customers (including upset ones), creating a clean and healthy kitchen, and processed payments (over $100,000 worth of orders).
```

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
When Im not working for others, I enjoy planning startups. Over the years Ive had hundreds of business ideas and even attempted to build out several.

```
Apart from working, I also love to drive, play video games, and watch TV. Driving, especially with friends, is a great way to pass the time, and a great way to calm down after a long day. Im currently driving a 2006 Pontiac Vibe, running strong with 215,000 miles. Playing video games has helped me to practice communication, decision-making skills, and hand-eye coordination skills. My current favorite game is Genshin Impact. Like most people, Im a fan of the easy-to-watch comedy, The Office. The closest thing to sports I participate in is swimmer and badminton. Temporarily, I even worked as an swimming and badminton coach.
```

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
Some of my key achievements are, creating a coding language wrapper installed over 85,000 times, managing social media marketing for a few small indie game development studios, creating an app with over 10,000 installs, and creating website templates used by nearly 1,000 people.
